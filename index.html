        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a middle aged Mum from the little island state off the southeast coast of Australia. I live with my 92yo grandmother, my 15yo son and my two Birman cats.</p>
        <p>I love learning about <em>almost</em> everything but have a particular interest in maths and technology. I've wanted to learn frontend development for some time, so enrolling in this Techdegree seems like a logical step towards that... <br>
          Besides if I don't bite the bullet and get started, there's a very real chance I may start turning into a 'crazy cat lady' and end up living out my days alone with my 28 cats!</p>
        <p>What else? <br>
          I became a tennis umpire at age 17 and have worked at the Australian Open and other professional events most years since. I've umpired all the greats of the game (and some of the not so greats) over the last 20 years!<em> Brag moment!</em></p>
        <p>I've studied Mathematics, Economics, Sport Management, Human Resources, Education, Media, Writing for the Web, Philosophy, Psychology and French at university level. But I find the best learning is done informally on my own, and there are so many cool and interesting things out there to be learned.</p>
        <p><em>This profile page marks the start of my learning journey in frontend development.</em></p>
        <!-- <p class="covid-paragraph">Added extra: <em>I have long COVID. I've had it and been really unwell since last Easter. It's a rubbish thing to have. It's also partly why I'm starting this Techdegree now. I can't go out and work at this point in time so I have oodles of time to pass and I'm hoping that as my skills build up this course will eventually lead to some freelance work from home.</em></p> -->

        <h2>What Do I Hope to Learn?</h2>
        <p>Like <em>presumably</em> everyone undertaking the Treehouse Techdegree in Frontend Development, I'm here to learn to build websites.</p>
        <p>I hope to further my skills and knowledge in a number of frontend languages, frameworks and technologies.</p>
        <p>Some of these include:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Github</li>
          <li>Responsive Design</li>
          <li>Flexbox</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Sass</li>
          <li>Version Control</li>
          <li>Dev Tools</li>
          <li>The OS X Terminal</li>
          <li>UX/UI</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope to collaborate and share my web development projects with my fellow Techdegree students and make some useful contacts with others in the industry.</p>
