        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Simply put, I'm the middle aged mother of a 15yo boy and two Birman cats.</p>
        <p>I love learning about <em>almost</em> anything (chemistry and the arts not included). I've always been pretty okay at and interested in technology so frontend development seems like a logical progression.</p>
        <p>Besides, if I don't bite the bullet and do it now there's a very real chance I could end up becoming a crazy cat lady living alone with 28 cats!</p>
        <p>What else? Oh, I became a tennis umpire at age 17 and have worked at the Australian Open and other professional events most years since. I've umpired all the greats of the game (and some of the not so greats) over the last 20 years! <em>Brag moment!</em></p>
        <p>I have studied Mathematics, Economics, Sport Management, Human Resources, Primary Education, Copywriting and a few random units like Philosophy, Media Studies and French. That's the formal stuff though, I much prefer doing my own reading and watching Explainer type videos. There are so many cool and interesting things out there just waiting to be learned.</p>
        <p class="covid-paragraph">Added extra: <em>I have long COVID. I've had it and been really unwell since last Easter. It's a rubbish thing to have. It's also partly why I'm starting this Techdegree now. I can't go out and work at this point in time so I have oodles of time to pass and I'm hoping that as my skills build up this course will eventually lead to some freelance work from home.</em></p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What Do I Hope to Learn?</h2>
        <p>Like <em>presumably</em> everyone who is undertaking the Treehouse Techdegree in Frontend Web Development, I'm here to learn to build websites.</p>
        <p>I hope to further my skills and knowledge in a number of frontend languages, frameworks and web technologies.</p>
        <p>Some of these include:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Github</li>
          <li>Responsive Design</li>
          <li>Flexbox</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Sass</li>
          <li>Version Control</li>
          <li>Dev Tools</li>
          <li>The OS X Terminal</li>
          <li>UX/UI</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope to collaborate and share my web development projects with my fellow Techdegree students and make some useful contacts with others in the industry.</p>
